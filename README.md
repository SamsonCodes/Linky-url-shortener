# Linky-url-shortener
A simple url shortener application using Express.

What does that mean? 

Linky is a web application that allows you to create shortcuts to urls of your choosing. Allowing you to navigate to them through a path appended to the home url (localhost) of this website. Like Bitly.

I made it for practise and it's not much. But if you find it useful for your own projects or personal use feel free to do so.
